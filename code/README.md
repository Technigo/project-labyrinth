# Project Labyrinth

The task is to build a text-based adventure game app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

The specific goals included:

- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay
- Use thunks to wrap your API calls (but you don't have to if you don't want to).
- Use redux to store a history of what the player has done
- Style each room/state based on the description
- Display a history of all the actions a player has taken
- Use localStorage to save
