# Project Labyrinth

This project was made by Maja Zimnoch and Ylva Karlsson - we did it with a pair-programming approach.
We worked with fetching from an API, and it is made with react-redux, we also used thunks for the first time.
We played around with styling by adding a lottie-animation as loader of the page. For the loading-component we used the useEffect-hook.

## The problem

We had some issues with styled-components but in the end everything worked out and we found the way out of the stable. :D
