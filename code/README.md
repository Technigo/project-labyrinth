# Project Labyrinth

The project was to create a text based game Labyrinth to practice how APIs work together with Redux. 


## The problem

We began with sketching up the project in jamboard and created all tasks we thougt need to be done. THen with a pairprogrammingapproach we started setting up the react boilerplate. It was a challenge to understand how to structure our redux store to suit our data. With React, Redux, Redus toolkit, styled components and Lottie animations we completed the project. 

If we had more time we would create pixel art to style our game more. And it would be interesting to have some kind of map showing the progress of the user.
