# Project Labyrinth
The goals of this project was to create a labyrinth game in Redux, using thunks to deal with API calls.

## The problem
As always, the hardest part was getting started. Once we'd set up the files, components and reducers (and created the first thunk), we quickly branched out. We ended up doing almost everything in branches, with a couple of merges throughout the week. To make the game functional, we created two thunks: one to deal with posting the username and one that deals with moves in the game. We nested everything in a Main-component, using conditionals to show either the loading-page, start-page or game-page. We also some customization, showing a different map on every page + different design for the final game-page.
Tools we used: Redux, React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Figma, Canva.
If we had more time:
- Create more styling-customisation for the individual pages.
- Make more use of the username throughout the game.
- Create more "intuitive" gameplay, like having the buttons placement match the direction.
