# Project Labyrinth

Retro-Labyrinth: Nina Berggren, Viktor Svensson

This was a pair project and we both worked with pair-programming and individually with different tasks.
The assignment was to build a game in react-Redux using thunks to build the communication with the backend and to fetch data with POST through an API. We practiced async actions. The game is a navigation game - a Labyrinth, where the progress is based on the users choice of direction. 

<!-- Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point. -->

## The problem

<!-- Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use?  -->

If we had more time, we had placed the direction buttons correctly in the "cross" ?
we would have tried to have the "loading" in the computer screen only inside the game.
Make a map of the Labyrinth as a hint-button.
