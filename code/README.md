# Project Labyrinth

This project is week 15 project of Technigo's Boot camp. 

The goal for this was to to use the API specified to build a frontend that gives the user control over what to do next. We practised to use thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.  

The minimun requirement of the project: 
- Your page should be responsive.
- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.
- Use thunks to wrap your API calls.
