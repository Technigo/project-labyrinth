# Project Labyrinth

This week the focus is on Redux and things such as async actions and other ways of writing Redux, without Redux toolkit.

Main goals:
✓ How to work with APIs together with Redux
✓ How to use thunks
✓ Other ways of writing Redux
✓ Reusable components
✓ How to structure your redux store to suit your data
✓ To send JSON in the body of a request

## The problem

We tested to use lottie animations by installing the lottie-package. 
We used thunks for the first time.
We got more experience in using reusable components.
