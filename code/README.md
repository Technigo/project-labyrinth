# Project Labyrinth

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

- How many reducers and how to use them, that was a challenge
- The positioning of Lottie
- Pain in the ass: Conditional rendering of local background images (googling around didn't help that much because most people use external links to images)
- Routing the restart was a bit challenging. We solved it by using useNavigate.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
