Project Labyrinth

This week was pair programming. I worked with Andreas, and we made a Labyrinth with Redux. We did different styling to get the full benefit from the learning experience. The story was not so fantastic for me, so I created a wow effect by making these images. I'm happy with them and how odd the vibes they are giving.

The problem

We have talked A LOT with Andreas to make everything more understandable for each other. And at least my polite Swedish friend has told me that even he has learned a lot by doing this. ;-)

I feel tired but happy, and all this crosslinking between React files makes more sense now.

Despite the project, we have also discussed what ideal work would be for us, etc. â€“Good week.
