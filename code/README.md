# Production Process

I started by planning the functionalities and layout for the project and dividing those into components.

Creating reducers was a new concept and this was a great oportunity to add different functionalities.

The filter for completed and uncompleted tasks was initially creating conflits when published on Netlify, but after changing it to the tasks file in the reducer, the conflits were solved
