# Project Labyrinth

This project is a text-based adventure game that allows the user to navigate a maze provided by a backend. It was built using React, Redux, and JavaScript.

## The problem

The main challenge of this project was building the communication between the frontend and the backend using Redux and thunks. I used the API provided to fetch the current location and its associated actions, and updated the state of the game accordingly. I also displayed the current location description and available actions to the user, and allowed the user to select their next move.

Technologies used:
React
Redux
JavaScript
Styled Components
TypeIt
UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)

Features:
User can navigate a text-based maze
User can select their next move
Game state is updated using Redux and thunks
Styled Components used for styling
TypeIt used for typewriter-style text animation
