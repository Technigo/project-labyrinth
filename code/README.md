# Project Labyrinth

A labyrinth game built with Redux and React.

## The problem

The project was built by Maria Sjögren and Emelie Söderhielm. We used mob programming as a development approach, using Visual Studio Code and the extension Live Share. We used Redux and React to create the app.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
