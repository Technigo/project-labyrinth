Project Labyrinth

This week was pair-programming. I worked with Andreas and we made a Labyrinth with Redux. Both of us did separate styling to get full benefit out of learning experience.

The problem

We have talked A LOT with Andreas to make everything more understandable for each other. And at least my polite Swedish friend has told me that even he has learned a lot by doing this as well. ;-)

I feel tired but happy, and at least all this crosslinking between React files makes slightly more sense now.

Despite the project, we have also managed to talk about what ideal work would be for us, etc. â€“Good week.
