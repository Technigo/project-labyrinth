# Project Labyrinth

This project was built by Sofia and Savannah, it is a game that allows users to navigate a maze, in the form of a 
text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

## The problem

The goal for this game was to fetch a list of actions from the backend and present them to the user as interactable 
items. We focused on creating our reducers and thunks to wrap our API calls. We thought about how to handle the delay
for the request to come back from the server by adding a loading state. 

We also display images based on the main description of the current room and use Redux to store a history of what the 
player has done. We focused on building and designing our game with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.
