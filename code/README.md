# Project Labyrinth
The assignment consisted of creating an app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.  

## The problem

We used pair-programming for the whole developement and didnÂ´t split up the tasks at all, that was fun to try. We learned alot about the technical parts of communicating and coding via distance. 
If we had more time we would have added different pictures for different directions in the maze and used redux to store a history of what the player has done.
