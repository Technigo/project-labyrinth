- should styles be broken out more?

animations example:

@keyframes myanimation {
  0% {background-color: red;}
  25% {background-color:yellow;}
  50% {background-color:green;}
  75% {background-color:brown;}
  100% {background-color: red;}
}

  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: 'Poppins', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',
    'Roboto', 'Oxygen', 'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans',
    'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;

  background-color: #8ec5fc;
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    120deg,
    #8ec5fc 0%,
    #e0c3fc 66%,
    #8ec5fc 0%,
    #e0c3fc 66%
  );
  background-size: 400%;
  animation: gradient-bg 5s infinite;
}

@keyframes gradient-bg {
  0% {background-position: 0 50%;}
  50% {background-position: 100% 50%;}
  100% {background-position: 0 50%;}

  25% {background-position: yellow;}
  50% {background-position: green;}
  75% {background-position: brown;}
  100% {background-position: red;}
}


### Description and Actions UI
How you present the description and the actions is completely up to you.  Maybe you want to sort the directions (East, North, West, South) or put them in some graphical order.  Perhaps you would like to add interactable compass.

Requirements ðŸ§ª
- Publish your site on Netlify.


ðŸ”´ Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**
- Use redux to store a history of what the player has done

âš« Black Level (Advanced Goals)**
- Display a history of all the actions a player has taken
- Persist redux store to localStorage, so the app data remains when you reload the page
- Create a visual representation (drawing) of the map/labyrinth that the player is navigating.  It could update after each action.  The coordinates might be helpful here, or you can track the directions yourself
