# Project Labyrinth

A project where a simple labyrinth game was made by the help of an API, the goal for us students was to be able to make use of React Redux, creating and using our own store and reducers.

## The problem

Creating the store and reducers took a fair amount of time but was not the largest consumer of time. The challenge was having enough time to make the CSS flow somewhat fluently. Creating the image render using props from the API was slightly challenging and came together well with a switch eventually.
