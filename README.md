# Project Labyrinth

This week's pair-programming project was to build a text based labyrinth game using React redux. When the game is started the user is presented with a few diffrerent direction options to move towards and based on the users choice the next step is generated. 

## The problem

We had some issues with fetching the games data from the API and in the end we noticed that the problem was due to a naming error in the function that was executing the fetch.
