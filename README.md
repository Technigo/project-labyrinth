# Project Labyrinth

This week's project was all about tying together the skills we've learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend (API) and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem

We had issues displaying the data from the API but with the help of Postman we were able to see how to fetch the data.
We used React, Redux, pair programming, API, Thunk, styled components
