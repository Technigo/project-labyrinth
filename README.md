# Project Labyrinth

The purpose of project was to practice async actions through a text adventure game, including:
- How to work with APIs together with Redux
- How to use thunks
- How to structure the redux store to suit the data

The game presents the user with directional options to get out of a maze. Actions are retrieved from the backend and presented to the user as interactable items.

The app was built by Arianna Allahyar and Sara Bostr√∂m Bundock.
