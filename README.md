# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair-programming project made by Jessica Hermansson and Rebecca Philipson.
The goal for this project was to build a text-based adventure game where the user navigates a maze and is able to choose between different options.

## The problem

We started by setting up the logic of the game, like fetching the data from the API using thunks. Once the the basic logic was working, we added a loading spinner to make the request response time okay for the users. For the styling we implemented several Lottie animations.
During this project we learned more about thunks and Redux and how to build the communication with the backend.
