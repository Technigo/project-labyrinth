# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair programming project made by Ida Halling and Isabell Wastfelt. We have built a Labyrinth Game UI that retrieves a list of actions from the backend, and present them as selectable directions for the player.

## The problem

We started out by making a flowchart on all of the steps while looking on out endpoints in Postman. And then we created the reducers and did our first fetch. We made some components and got the game to appear from our fetch.
We wantet an urban explorer theme. We used styled components, and used props for the different background images.
