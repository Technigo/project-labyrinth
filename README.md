# Project Labyrinth

This week's assignment is to build an app which allows a user to navigate in a text-based maze. We were provided by a backend so we can retrieve a list of actions och present it on our website.

## The problem

We learned to use a provided API together with React Redux, and practising how to use thunks, structure Redux store, Redux toolkit, and personally I used Lotties for the animations.
This week's challenge for me was to create a visual map of showing the taken steps. It was fun to design a certain pattern I wanted and I'd try out different solutions.
If I had more time I would like to focusing more on making the UX better.
