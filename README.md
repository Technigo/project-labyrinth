# Project Labyrinth

This week's project is all about tying together the skills learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.
We used redux to store the current state of the game and thunks to wrap the API calls.

## The problem

First we laid out our design on figma - which included the goals,  the components needed and some preliminary design ideas. The we worked on setting up the redux store with reducers and thunks together. We then split up to work on functionality and design. We drew help from other team mates, stackoverflow and google in general. If we had more time, we would create a blinking red dot on the map and store player moves to local storage.
