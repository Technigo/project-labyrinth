# Project Labyrinth

The goal of this assignment was to create a labyrinth by using Redux and API's.

## The problem

First planning due to this being a pair programming project we decided to start with the basics and going through what type of design/styling we wanted to apply.

We when made our first components and also our first reducers.
We used React, Redux, JSX and CSS for this project.

Adding a chaging background depending on the question from the API.
