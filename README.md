# Project Labyrinth

This week's task was to build a text-based game where the user navigates through a labyrinth, using React and Redux. We practiced writing thunks and worked together in pairs.

## The brief

This week's project is all about tying together the skills you've learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

**What you need to do**

✓ Your page should be responsive.

✓ Use redux to store the current state of the game.

✓ Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.

✓ Use thunks to wrap your API calls.
