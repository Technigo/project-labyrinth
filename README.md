# 🗿Project Labyrinth🏔 -Linda and Katarina-👯‍♀️

This week's pair-programming project was to build a Maze-like game using Redux and Thunks! The Maze presents a couple of possible moves to the user, and based on their choice, the next step is generated (using the game coordinates). The user has an opportunity of going back to the previous step, by clicking on the -back- button. At the very end, the user is then presented with the final coordinate, and a -play again- button!

## How we approached the project:

The challenge of this very game was that we had to build -everything- from scratch. We started off by creating a POST request in Postman, changing the username and looking up all the coordinates of the game, so that we can plan each step accordingly. We sketched out each step with respective move options, and based on that, we implemented a simple yet somewhat intuitive design that will guide the user through the different rooms of the Maze. 

✨To start off with, we built our reducers 🧩
-a game, and a reusable reducer/thunk. This was very challenging and a lot of fun when we got it work and use all the benefits of thunks. 

Slowly but surely, we started creating each one of the components. To challenge ourselves further, we used 💅styled-components and even implemented a very cool loader from an npm react package, as well as some other small styling alternatives.
