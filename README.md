# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair programming project made by Ida Halling and Isabell Wastfelt. We have built a Labyrinth Game UI that retrieves a list of actions from the backend, and present them as selectable directions for the player.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
