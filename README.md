# Project Labyrinth

This weeks assignment was to create a labyrinth game using React and Redux with thunks.

## The problem

Our biggest issue was making the post requests work. More specifically to retrieve the feedback from the API.
It turned out that we were sending the wrong data and as we corrected that things worked again. 
Generally the issues have been syntax related and as we got a boost in the right direction we managed to fix things.

Another issue was to display the direction the player took. We only managed to retrieve all possible choices rather than the path of the player.
As we got another boost in the right direction we also managed to solve this.

In conclusion the hardest thing this week has been the syntax in combination with using post requests.
But in hindsight we've learned a lot about both syntax and post requests.
