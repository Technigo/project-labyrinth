# Project Labyrinth

The objective of this project was to practise using thunks and how to do API-calls using Redux. We were given an existing API with the game logic and were to implement it in the frontend. 

## The problem

We started by setting up the basic game, using thunks for the API calls. To give the game a retro style we used the NES.css library. Our biggest challenge was creating a map of the labyrinth that shows currect location of the user. We did this by using the coordinates from the API and changing classNames to make the current tile blink.
