# Project Labyrinth

This assignment was to create a text-based game using a provided backend api. The main focus was to learn how to handle api-calls in redux, with thunks.

## The problem

i started out testing the api calls in postman. when i had them in place, i started investigating thunks and how to use them. when the api-calls were in place i went on with styling.
