# Project Labyrinth

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure. Classic games like this usually present the user with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do.

Requirements:

* Your page should be responsive.
* Use redux to store the current state of the game.
* Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.
* Use thunks to wrap your API calls
* Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

We made weekly plan in figma. Wrote down what features and tasks we believed this project would contain, prioritiesed our post-its and agreed on an MVP. Made a basice design and turned it into wireframes for different devices. Started coding by breaking down the problem. (Fetch data, create reducers, a form, show next decription based on coordinates)

Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Redux
* fetch
* styled components
* Lottie animation
* ESLint for code formatting
* Netlify for deployment
* Git for collaboration
* Figma for planning and design
