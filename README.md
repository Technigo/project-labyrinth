# Project Labyrinth

Text based adventure where the user navigates a Labyrinth. Built in React and Redux in pairs.

## The problem

Started analyzing the game requirements and what the backend API provides using Postman. Thereafter we built the Redux store, and set up the component structure. When the basic structure was in place, we continued building thunks fetching the API data from backend. Styling was done inspired by the traditional text based game adventure games, and we added functionality of Loading and responsive styling in the end.

Next step if revisiting: implement user input for user name.
