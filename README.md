# Project Labyrinth 🏜️

This week Jin and I built a labyrinth game. A project which allows the user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text based adventure, provided by a backend.

## The problem

We started off by planning the week and split the tasks since we didn't have a lot of time for pair programming due to our different schedules. But it turned out really well! Communication is key!
