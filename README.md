# Project Labyrinth

This project is a text-based adventure game that allows the user to navigate a maze provided by an API. It was built in React using Redux.

## The problem

The task was to connect a front end user interface to the backend API provided by Technigo, and make an immersive text-based game out of it. The main challenge this week was to fetch from the API while working with Redux, i.e. using thunks to handle asynchronous actions.

For this weeks assignment I was very short on time, since I had to finish early due to traveling. Because of this, the code is not as structured and concise as I would want it to. If I had more time, I would go back and clean it up.
