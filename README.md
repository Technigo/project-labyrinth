# Project Labyrinth

Project for a text based adventure navigation through a maze. Built with react redux using thunks for API post fetch.

Made by Tomoyo and Li.

## The problem

The game is built in Redux, by using Thunks. We started off codealong this weeks lectures, and then used the React skills we learned so far to built this. We also implemented Lottie for an animation for loading page.

If we had more time we would've wanted to add history and back-button function.
