# Project Labyrinth

The task was to create a "labyrinth-game" using an API. We were to create a start-page, a loading page (when api-calls took too long) and a game page with options for which direction to go.

## The problem

We first approached the problem by creating a reducer to make sure whe had all the functions to be able to take care of the problem. Then we used thunks for the fetches and created components to utilize these.
We didn't plan too much with this project which we may have done differently if doing it again. If we had more time we would have worked more on styling and tried to use styled components.
