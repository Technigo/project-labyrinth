## The problem

<!-- Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next? -->

We started out making a redux store and a couple of reducers for managing the Username input for starting the Maze and for the navigation through the maze.
