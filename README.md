# Project Labyrinth

practicing fetch API in redux
//project lacking styling 

## The problem

using postman to get the json file in console, and to understand what items are needed to extract aka. read the json file was a difficult. What's inside button is both {type} and {direction} which took me a long time to understand. 

Learnings:
1) Postman, 
2) Reading and understanding the returned json. file from fetched urls, 
3) The logic applied to the GameDisplay page. ie. actions.length === 0 / actions.length >0, and actions.length <0, took me forever to figure out. Finally realized the logic should be based on actions, because actions is an array, and the descriptions+type returned is based on which item in the array.
