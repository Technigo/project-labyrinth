# Project Labyrinth

The React project includes Redux-related topics, such as using thunks for async actions, working with APIs, and using Redux Toolkit. The project was pair-programmed.
The project uses APIs with Redux, using thunks and reusable components and sends JSON in the body of a request.

## The problem

We planned which components and animations to use in a Trello board. We started out pair-programming in the Master branch. We then branched out in different branches. We met up and did a merge on each branch, and then we branched out again. We merged and pair-programmed again and attempted to make some changes regarding the background images. If we hade more time, we would have had one backround image for the startpage, another for the game questions and a third background image for the end page. We consuled ChatGPT with various results.
