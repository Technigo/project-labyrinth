# Project Labyrinth

The project brief was to build a maze which allows a user to navigate through a text-based adventure, provided by an API, using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.

## The problem

We approached this weeks project by methodically moving forward and exploring this weeks lectures code, but also from previous weeks. When having issues, we always discussed them together and tried to come to a solution either by trial and error or googling.
