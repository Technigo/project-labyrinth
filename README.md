# Project Labyrinth

This week we were pair-programming. I worked with friend Peki and we made a Labyrinth App i Redux.

## The problem

This week we talked alot about how everything was connected in redux. We did not manage to do the most advanced app but we realy understod what we were writing. For the styling we splitted in two and made our own styling. I had this idea with helpfull illustrations.
