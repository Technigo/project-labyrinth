# Project Labyrinth
Labyrinth is a text-based adventure game where the player gets options with direction on each step. The goal of the game is to pass through the labyrint and find a way out.

The project uses Redux to store data, fetches data from an API and POST request to an API. The project uses a nostalgic theme in its styling which is taken from a nes.css library

## The problem

We faced some issues throughout the project, one problem was to POST our actions to our API and get responds, but we managed to solve that issue by sending a specific object which automatically gets respond when posting it.

If we had more time, we wanted to display each step taken by the player by creating a drawing board.
