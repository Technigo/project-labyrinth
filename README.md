# Project Labyrinth

Using React, Redux toolkit, Lotties and an API built by technigo we have created a labyrinth game. This game was built by Jennifer Feenstra-Arengard, Nora Terbocs, and Nina Waldreus.
## The problem

First we created a Figma file with the design of the project, we included each step a player could take and the text that would be returned with the API in order to find suitable background images. Then we used a pair programming approach to create the main components. When the main functionality of the project was working we divided the tasks to work on our own schedules. 

If we had more time we could have added some music, shown a history of what the player has done and created a back button.
