# Project Labyrinth

This week's project was a pair-programming project made by Sara Stjernberg, Petra Almgren and Emmma Urman. The task was to build an app in the form of a text-based adventure/Labyrinth game. In the project we use an API which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items. The users is presented with a description of where they are, and also get two options for which direction they can take go go forward in the labyrinth.
