# Project Labyrinth
The purpose with this project was to make a labyrinth-game by using React Redux with thunks.

## The problem
The first thing we did was to make a Trello board with all the requirements from the brief that we needed to do. We started with creating the reducer where we fetched our data with thunks and continued with the rest of the components. We got stuck a couple of times but managed to solve it by testing diffrent things and looking things up.
