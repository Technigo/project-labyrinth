## ToDo
## **ðŸ”µ Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Your page should be responsive.
- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay
- Use thunks to wrap your API calls (but you don't *have to* if you don't want to).

## **ðŸ”´ Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- Show the descriptions of the directions in the main description of the current room.  Present clear and simple actions.  For example, your button would say *"Go East"*.  Instead of *"East -A worn sign 'The Temple of *ech*igo'. Some of the letters are missing. An overgrown paved path leads to the East"*
- Use redux to store a history of what the player has done
- If you want to focus more on design and make or use a design library (for example [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/))

## **âš« Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Style each room/state based on the description.  For instance, if it contains the word "forest" you may want to change the background to a forest
- Display a history of all the actions a player has taken
- Persist redux store to localStorage, so the app data remains when you reload the page
- Create a visual representation (drawing) of the map/labyrinth that the player is navigating.  It could update after each action.  The coordinates might be helpful here, or you can track the directions yourself


# Project Labyrinth

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
