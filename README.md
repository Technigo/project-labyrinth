# Project Labyrinth

We've been given the task to build the labyrinth game posting an API using thunks and displaying the response in the frontend. This was a pair programming project.

## The problem

We began with fetching the first response from the API after sending a username. Once it worked, we added the other API fetch to continue the game, stored the history in Redux store, used an animation in the end section and made the styling with styled components.

If we had more time, we would have put more time in creating animated pages between each player choice.
