# Project Labyrinth

Using React, Redux toolkit,Redux thunks, Lotties animation and an API built by Technigo in order to create a labyrinth game. This game was built by Jennifer Feenstra-Arengard, Nora Terbocs.
## The problem

First we created a Figma file where we started the planning of the project, including designing the structure of the app, understanding the response from the API and dividing the workload.
Then we used a pair programming approach to create the main components. When the main functionality of the project was working we divided the tasks based on the remaining tasks of our sketch.

If we had more time we could have added some music, shown a history of what the player has done and created a back button.
