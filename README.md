# Project Labyrinth

This is a recreation of the classic Labyrinth Game. This week it was Sandra (https://github.com/sandra-shumanteva-kaevska) and I who did the programming as a pair. 

##Tech used : React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, JSX, Material UI, Pair Programming, Github, Netlify

## The problem

We had conflict in dispatch when we were trying to get the history. We solved it by creating two different dispatches with more actions to solve it.
