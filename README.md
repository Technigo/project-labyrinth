# Project Labyrinth

The Labyrinth projects aims to build a redux application by using a thunk function and API POST method.

## The problem
I used Thunk function for reusable button which will POST the data of each movement of the player to the API.
In term of styling, I managed to have a video background, using styled-components.
I still have a problem in the 'kep' when mapping throught the array in the History.
Should I have more time, I would learn to use differnt background iamge for differient actions.
