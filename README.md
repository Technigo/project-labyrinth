# Project Labyrinth - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

This project was all about tying together the skills I have learned to build an app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure.

Learning Objectives:
- How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
- How to structure your redux store to suit your data
- To send JSON in the body of a request

## Approach


## Core Tech
<!-- - CSS
- API
- React
- React Hooks
- JSX -->



## Requirements Completed
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- The page should be responsive.
- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Focus on making the UX of the app good. Handle the response delay
- Use thunks to wrap API calls.

ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
- Show the descriptions of the directions in the main description of the current room.  Present clear and simple actions. 
<!-- - Use redux to store a history of what the player has done -->
<!-- - If you want to focus more on design and make or use a design library (for example [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)) -->

<!-- âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals) -->
<!-- - Style each room/state based on the description.  For instance, if it contains the word "forest" you may want to change the background to a forest -->
<!-- - Display a history of all the actions a player has taken -->
<!-- - Persist redux store to localStorage, so the app data remains when you reload the page -->
<!-- - Create a visual representation (drawing) of the map/labyrinth that the player is navigating.  It could update after each action.  The coordinates might be helpful here, or you can track the directions yourself -->
