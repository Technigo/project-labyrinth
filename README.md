# Project Labyrinth
Group project with Vera and Jonas and Irup√© where we build a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.


## The problem
This week's project involved diving deeper into Redux and working with APIs and thunks. The project also covered the structuring of Redux stores, reusable components, and sending JSON in the body of a request. 
We started with mob-programing to then branchout and then mob-programing again. 

Tools and Technologies Used
React
Redux
JSONPlaceholder
Visual Studio Code
Git and GitHub
