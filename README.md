# Project Labyrinth

This week we used react and redux to create a labyrinth game. We used a thunk to fetch API's and styled everything with styled components.

## The problem

We used google and looked at other students projects to solve our problems. There was a lot of trial and error, but we managed to solve almost everything.
If we had more time we would have liked to add some background audio and user history making it possible to go back in the game.
