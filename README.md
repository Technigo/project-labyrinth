# Project Labyrinth

This week's project is all about tying together the skills you've learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

✓ Your page should be responsive.
✓ Use redux to store the current state of the game.
✓ Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.
✓ Use thunks to wrap your API calls.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
