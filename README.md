# Project Labyrinth

This week's project is all about tying together the skills you've learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

✓ Your page should be responsive.
✓ Use redux to store the current state of the game.
✓ Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.
✓ Use thunks to wrap your API calls.

## The problem

We started the week going through the material individually and then got started on the project together through LiveShare. We decided on a design and created store, reducers and thunk together and got everything to work before splitting up. Bridget made a branch to keep the user history and show a map of the steps and Fanny made a branch for styling and change of background in the different rooms.
When done we merged together and did the final touches before deploying.
