# Project Labyrinth

The goal of this project is to build a text-based Maze game adventure using React Redux and thunks.

## What we learned

- First approach to communication with the Backend > sending and receiving data.
- Storing actions in Redux's global store.
- Each post request is performed via a thunk with does the fetch, gathers the response data and passes the data to the reducer in our Redux store. This reducer then saves the data into the global store, becoming the current game state.
- Styled components and nes.css (nostalgic retro styling).
