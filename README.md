# Project Labyrinth

The classic text-based labyrinth game. Turn up the volume and solve the game.

## The problem

This project used React and Redux Toolkit to display and move you along the labyrinth. The description of the way is hidden and can be toggles to show if you press a emoji below the direction. The background changes with the help of a switcher and reflect the description.
