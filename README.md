# Project Labyrinth

Project for a text based adventure navigation through a maze. Built with react redux using thunks for API post fetch.

By Daniel Vestin & Elin Elmvik Diczfalusy

## The problem

We started out making a redux store and a couple of reducers for managing the Username input for starting the Maze and for the navigation through the maze.

- React components
- Redux and Redux toolkit
- switch function
- hooks: useSelector, useDispatch, useState

- API POST request
- Asynchronous API calls using thunks

- Responsive styling
- Styled components

If we had more time we would've wanted to add history and back-button function.
