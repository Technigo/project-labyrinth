# Project Labyrinth

This weeks project was to build an old school computer labyrinth game using an external API. 

## The problem

Since this week was a group project, we started by planning on how and when we could work together. We started by looking at the API and how we did POST and what we got back. We structured the project and decided what reducers and components we needed. Then we started to build the game by adding a game reducer and thunks to fetch the API. With all the functions in place we started on the styling. No major problems this week. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
