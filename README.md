# Week 15: Project Labyrinth

This week's project was to build a labyrinth app posting to an API using thunks and displaying the response in an interactive frontend. This was a pair programming project.

## The problem

We started by fetching the first response from the API after sending a username. Once it was working, we added the other API fetch to continue the game, stored the history in Redux store, added a loading animation with Lottie, used FontAwesome icons to illustrate the moves history and made the styling with styled components.

If we had more time, we would have put more time in creating more reusable styled components.
