# Project Labyrinth

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp and the assignment was to build a labyrinth game using a given API, using React and Redux Toolkit.

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure. Classic games like this usually present the user with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do.

Based on choice, the state of the game (where the player is) will update. Then, a new description and set of actions can be displayed to the player.

Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)

- Your page should be responsive.
- Use redux to store the current state of the game
- Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay
- Use thunks to wrap your API calls (but you don't have to if you don't want to).

## The problem

We struggled a bit in the beginning of the week and got stuck with some errors that we couldn't solve, which put us back a bit. But on day 4 we finally solved it and could implement some styling and UX.

We took a lot of inspiration from previous students' work and understood the potential of this project, beyond what we thought. So we got some inspiration to create a nice design and with an image for each coordinate so that the user would visually get a better understanding of where they were in the labyrinth.

## If we had more time...

- We wanted to have instead of an image for each coordinate a video. But we couldn't get that to work unfortunately, but we think that would have been a cool feature. (we left the code for that in comments in the Labyrinth.js)
- We would implement a restart function
