##Project Labyrinth

In this project we allow the used  to navigate  through a text-based adventure maze provided by a backend.
We used an API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next.
The project is build through pair-programming 

##How we built it

This is our first project where we  used thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.
We started out by creating all the reducers and basic components to get all the functionality to work. After we got the API to work and the game to appear we added an animated loader from the library Lottie . All styling is made through React Redux Styled Components. We changed the background colours through switch statement(components/Game.js) .
