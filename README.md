# Project Labyrinth

A project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend. This week dug deeper into redux and went through things such as async actions and other ways of writing Redux, without Redux toolkit. This project was built by Sandra Olsson, Nina Ströyer and Emilia G. Anundi. 

## The problem

✓ How to work with APIs together with Redux

✓ How to use thunks

✓ Other ways of writing Redux

✓ Reusable components

✓ How to structure your redux store to suit your data

✓ To send JSON in the body of a request
