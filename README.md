# Project Labyrinth

This week's project was all about tying together the skills we have learnt to build an app which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

The goal for this week was to use the API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. Focus on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.
