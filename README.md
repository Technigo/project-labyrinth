# Project Labyrinth

A text-based labyrinth game made in Redux.

## The problem

Tried to get the main functionality going first, but encountered a few snags on the way. After help from ChatGPT and StackOverflow I finally got the game to work. When I added styled components though, something happened to crash the game. Fixed a syntax error in one of the styled components, which got the game going again.
