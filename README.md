Project Labyrinth 🀗 🀗 🀗
This is a pair-programming project together with Anna Hasselström. We have built a game which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

We have used a specified API to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. Our focus was to use thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.

The project 📝

In this project we worked with an API with two endpoints: one url started the game and this one we only asked for once, using a POST request. The second endpoint handled the actions the user chose to perform. The response depended on the action made. We performed POST requests using this url every time the user made an action. Redux was used to store and manage state of game.

Workflow 🛠

Tried to visualize the end result
Investigated the api endpoints in Postman
Got the game started in our browser without any connection yet to the Redux store
Created store and slice with reducers
Connected the API responses to the Redux store using thunks with the fetches (by using thunks we can manage the asynchronousity and prevent a user from performing an new action before the first response is received from the server and updated in Redux store).
Created components responsible for starting the game and for playing the game
Displayed the actions and instructions from the responses
Updated the gamestate on each user action
Added styling using styled components
The enterd username will show on the playing page, as a unique greeting to the player 
We have a ending page that vill show the last description of the game and a button to start over. 
Features 🚥

The page is responsive - we use media queries for this
Redux is used to store the current state of the game
We have a loading feature to improve UX if the response takes some time
We wrap our API calls in thunks
We use styled components to style our page
Redux store is also used to store the history of player action - displayed in a back-button
Learnings 🔑

How to make API calls around Redux using thunks
How to structure a redux store to suit the data available
To send JSON in the body of a request
Had we have had more time.. 🤓

We would have liked to make the buttons re-usable and also understand localStorage better and how to implement it. Perhaps also structure the styling in separate files.
