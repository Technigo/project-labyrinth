# Project Labyrinth

The Cavern Quest game is a Classic in a text-based adventure, which allows the user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

The problem
The game is built in Redux, by using Thunks. We started off by exploring this weeks lectures code, and then used the React skills we learned so far to built this interactive game. If we had more time we wold work more on the styling and made an animation of the loading screen.
