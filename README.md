# Project Labyrinth

We created a game that worked through fetching clues and information from an API and giving them to the player as interactive actions. We used Redux to store the current state of the game, used thunks to wrap our API calls, and focused on making the UX of the app good by handling the response delay. We did this through using Lottie animations. 

## The problem

We began by checking out the API on the Postman and figuring out the structure of the game and what should show to the player. We then set up the components and reducers of the game, and got our API calls to work and all the data to show in the correct place. We did this all through pair-programming. After this we split up to work on styling using styled components, and setting up the Lottie animations for the Start, Loading and Finish pages. We then came back together to ensure all of the game was working correctly. If we had more time we would create a visual representation of the labyrinth that the player is navigating.
