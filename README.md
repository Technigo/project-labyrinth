# Production Process

We started by planning the projects and it’s components / screens.
We made thunks for the asynchronous functions, such as the API post request to display the game steps and the loading component. There’s also local storage to store the player’s position on the game.
We used conditional rendering to be able to show different screens based on the game conditions.
We created a final page that display the players choice history for the whole game. There’s also a restart button that reloads the game and empty the username field.
