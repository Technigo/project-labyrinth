# Project Labyrinth

This week's project is all about tying together the skills you've learnt to build an app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

**What you need to do**

✓ Your page should be responsive.

✓ Use redux to store the current state of the game.

✓ Focus on making the UX of your app good. Handle the response delay.

✓ Use thunks to wrap your API calls.

## The problem


In this week's project, you'll be building a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

The goal for this week is to use the API specified to build a frontend that gives the user control over what to do next. You'll focus on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend. Beyond that, you'll have a lot of freedom.

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure. Classic games like this usually present the user with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do.
